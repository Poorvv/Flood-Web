                    <li><b>River floods:</b></li>
                    <p>River floods occur when water levels in a river exceed their normal boundaries, inundating surrounding areas. This can result from heavy rainfall, rapid melting of snow, or a combination of factors. Floods can have devastating effects on communities, causing damage to infrastructure, displacing people, and disrupting ecosystems. Effective flood management and early warning systems are crucial in mitigating the impact of river floods.</p>

                    <li><b>Coastal floods:</b></li>
                    <p>Coastal floods, happen when water from the ocean spills over onto coastal land. This can be triggered by storms, high tides, or a combination of both. Storm surges, where strong winds from a storm push seawater ashore, are a common cause. Coastal floods pose significant risks to coastal communities, impacting both human settlements and ecosystems. Adequate coastal management strategies, like seawalls and early warning systems, are essential for minimizing the damage caused by these floods.</p>

                    <li><b>Urban floods:</b></li>
                    <p>Urban floods, typically occur in densely populated areas due to intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems. In urban environments, the high amount of impermeable surfaces like roads and buildings reduces natural water absorption, leading to rapid runoff. Inadequate drainage infrastructure and urban planning can exacerbate the problem. Urban floods can disrupt transportation, damage property, and pose risks to public safety. Effective stormwater management, improved infrastructure, and sustainable urban planning are crucial to mitigating the impact of urban floods.</p>
                
                    <li><b>Agricultural floods:</b></li>
                    <p>Agricultural floods, occur when excessive water affects farmland, either through heavy rainfall, river overflow, or other water sources. These floods can have detrimental effects on crops, leading to soil erosion, nutrient loss, and in severe cases, crop failure. Proper water management, including drainage systems and soil conservation practices, is essential for minimizing the impact of agricultural floods. Additionally, early warning systems and strategic planning can help farmers protect their crops and livelihoods in the face of such natural events.</p>

                    <li><b>Flash floods:</b></li>
                    <p>Flash floods are rapid and intense floods that occur within a short period, often within minutes or hours of heavy rainfall or other sudden events like dam breaks. These floods can be particularly dangerous due to their swift onset and the powerful force of the rushing water. Flash floods can happen in various environments, from urban areas to mountainous regions. They pose a significant threat to life, property, and infrastructure. Early warning systems and public awareness are crucial in minimizing the risks associated with flash floods.</p>
