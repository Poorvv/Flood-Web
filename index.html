            <p>Floods are natural disasters that arise from the overflow of water, submerging land that is typically dry. They are among the most common and widespread of all natural hazards, impacting regions across the globe. Floods can occur suddenly, with little warning, or develop gradually as a result of prolonged rainfall or snowmelt. This unpredictability makes them a significant concern for communities and governments worldwide. <br><br>

            The fundamental driver of a flood is an imbalance in the water cycle. Natural processes, such as rainfall and snowfall, provide essential water sources for our ecosystems. However, when these processes become extreme or imbalanced, they can lead to an excessive accumulation of water, setting the stage for flooding.</p>

                There are several types of floods that can occur, and it's important to understand the differences between them. Here are some of the main types of floods:<br><br>
                1. River floods: These occur when a river overflows its banks due to heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. River floods can be caused by a variety of factors, including heavy rainfall, snowmelt, dam failures, or a combination of these. <br><br>
                2. Coastal floods: These occur when high tides, storm surges, or sea level rise cause water to overflow into coastal areas. Coastal floods can be caused by a variety of factors, including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, nor'easters, or storm surges. <br><br>
                let us get a brief idea about various types of floods are there.

                The government of India has taken several initiatives to mitigate the impact of floods in the country. These include the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is responsible for disaster management and response, and the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), which provides crop insurance to farmers affected by floods. Additionally, the government has launched several flood control and mitigation projects, such as the Namami Gange program, which aims to clean and restore the Ganges River.
