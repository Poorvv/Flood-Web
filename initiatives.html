        <h2 class="sub-title">National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA):</h2>
        <p>The NDMA was established in 2005 to formulate policies, plans, and guidelines for disaster management. It plays a central role in coordinating and implementing measures to mitigate the impact of floods. The NDMA collaborates with state disaster management authorities and various ministries to ensure a coordinated response during flood events.</p>
        <h2>Flood Forecasting and Warning Systems:</h2>
        <p>India has a network of flood forecasting and warning systems. These systems rely on meteorological data, river gauges, and advanced technology to monitor rainfall, river levels, and weather patterns. When a potential flood situation is detected, early warnings are issued to vulnerable areas, allowing people to evacuate and take necessary precautions.
        </p>
        <h2>River Basin Management:</h2>
        <p>The National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) aims to clean and rejuvenate major rivers in India, which can help reduce the severity of floods. Integrated Watershed Management Programs (IWMP) focus on conserving water resources, soil, and vegetation in river catchment areas to minimize runoff and erosion.
        </p>
        <h2>Flood Control Infrastructure:</h2>
        <p>The construction of dams, reservoirs, and embankments is vital for flood control. For example, the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River and the Tehri Dam on the Bhagirathi River have been instrumental in flood regulation. These structures store excess water during the monsoon season and release it gradually to prevent downstream flooding.
        </p>
        <h2>Community-Based Disaster Management:</h2>
        <p>To ensure effective disaster response at the local level, the government encourages the formation of disaster management committees. These committees comprise community members who are trained in disaster preparedness and response. They play a crucial role in immediate relief efforts during floods.
        </p>
        <h2>Research and Development:</h2>
        <p>Ongoing research and development activities focus on improving flood modeling, early warning systems, and innovative flood control measures. This includes the use of remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and computer modeling to predict and manage flood scenarios more effectively. <br>
